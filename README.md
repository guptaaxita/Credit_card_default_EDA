# Credit_card_default_EDA
Pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of credit card defaults data. 

Problem:
1) Increase in customer default rates - This is bad for Credit One since we approve the customers for loans in the first place.
2) Revenue and customer loss for clients and, eventually, loss of clients for Credit One
Investigative Questions:

How do you ensure that customers can/will pay their loans? Can we do this?
As you progress through the tasks at hand begin thinking about how to solve this problem. Here are some lessons we learned form a similar problem we addressed last year:

1) We cannot control customer spending habits
2) We cannot always go from what we find in our analysis to the underlying "why"
3) We must on the problem(s) we can solve: What attributes in the data can we deem to be statistically significant to the problem at hand?
4) What concrete information can we derive from the data we have?
5) What proven methods can we use to uncover more information and why?
